# Dynamic Background - HTML Editor PRO


## Overview

Dynamic Background is a collection of dynamic and interactive backgrounds implemented using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other libraries. These backgrounds have been integrated into our Android app, "HTML Editor PRO," using WebView to provide an engaging and visually appealing user experience.

## Backgrounds

The repository includes a variety of dynamic backgrounds, each with its own unique style and interactivity. Users can choose from the available backgrounds to customize their experience while using the "HTML Editor PRO" app.

## How to Use

### Android Studio Integration

To integrate the Dynamic Backgrounds into your Android app using Android Studio, follow these steps:

1. Download the repository's ZIP file and extract it to a location of your choice.

2. Copy the assets from the `index.html` folder, which contains all the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the dynamic backgrounds.

3. In your Android Studio project, navigate to the `assets` folder. If it doesn't exist, create a new folder named `assets` under the `main` directory.

4. Paste the contents of the `Backgrounds` folder into the newly created `assets` folder in your Android Studio project.

5. Open the activity or fragment where you want to display the dynamic background using WebView.

6. In the layout XML file of the activity or fragment, add a WebView element to display the background. For example:

```xml
<WebView
    android:id="@+id/webView"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent" />
```

7. In your Java/Kotlin code, find the WebView by its ID and load the `index.html` file from the assets folder into the WebView. Here's an example in Kotlin:

```kotlin
val webView: WebView = findViewById(R.id.webView)
webView.settings.javaScriptEnabled = true
webView.loadUrl("file:///android_asset/index.html")
```

8. Build and run your Android app on a device or emulator, and you should see the dynamic background displayed within the WebView.
